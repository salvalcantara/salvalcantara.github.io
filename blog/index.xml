      <description>Among the different cryptocurrencies out there, I feel very excited about what IOTA can bring to the table. Perhaps in the future I can find the time to write about it from a technical perspective and make a real contribution to its community. Today&amp;rsquo;s post is just to have some fun while the sleeping giant takes the world by storm.
The genesis. One day my brother played a song from basshunter on his phone.</description>

      <description>This (my very first) post covers what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to refer as the motherfucker migration in Django. You can find the accompanying code, as well as detailed instructions on how to apply it, here.
For the sake of explanation, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a Django app with the following two (oversimplified) related models:
class Author(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=30, primary_key=True)  class Article(models.Model): title = models.CharField(max_length=140) authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author, related_name=&#39;articles&#39;)  In short, authors write articles, and an article can have one or more authors.</description>
