Hi! My name is Salva Alcántara. I currently live in Rubí (Barcelona), Spain, with my beautiful wife and son. I studied Computer Science/Engineering at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. At the same university, I pursued a PhD on Industrial Informatics/Automatic Control.


During my thesis years, I made two research stays: one at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Weidong Zhang](http://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/en/ShowPeople.aspx?info_id=303&info_lb=326&flag=224), and the second one at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, supervised by prof. [Sigurd Skogestad](http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/sigurd.skogestad). Apart from working on my thesis, I also got enrolled in the Mathematics degree and completed the first three years (covering all the compulsory subjects) and some of the final year electives, however, I did not eventually complete the degree (I would still need three more electives plus the final degree project) mostly due to time restrictions, especially after defending my thesis. Anyway, it was fun and I enjoyed the ride a lot.


After finishing my PhD, I stayed one more year in my home department and obtained the accreditation for the (non-tenure track) Assistant Professor (Spanish level) and *Professor Lector* (Catalonia) positions. That proved to be a futile task because it would turn out to be rather difficult to get a position at the university eventually. I finally moved to Zwolle (The Netherlands), where I worked as a Postdoctoral Marie Curie research fellow for two years in the company [Pure Air Solutions](http://www.pureairsolutions.nl/en/site/odour-and-voc-control) within the european IAPP project [Next Air Biotreat](http://www.nextairbiotreat.eu/). Then, I came back to Barcelona and started a new job as a Project (Automation) Engineer. After one year or so I decided to shift my career and have since then worked as a full stack developer in [Talaia](https://www.talaia.io/), a startup where we do what it takes to offer the best cloud-based network visibility as a service.


In the field of Computer Science/Engineering my interests include distributed systems, big data applications and machine learning (I am currently enrolled on the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)). I'm lately getting into cryptocurrencies, too. Finally, I have also a taste for the signal processing and automatic control fields.


I will try to keep this page up to date (sort of), but if you have any questions or simply want to say hi please drop me a line [here](mailto:hi@salvalcantara.com).
