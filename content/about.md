Hi! My name is Salva Alcántara. I currently live in Rubí (Barcelona), Spain, with my beautiful wife and son. I studied Computer Science (Engineering) at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. At the same university, I pursued a PhD on Industrial Informatics & Automatic Control.


During my thesis years, I made two research stays: one at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Weidong Zhang](http://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/en/ShowPeople.aspx?info_id=303&info_lb=326&flag=224), and the other one at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, supervised by prof. [Sigurd Skogestad](http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/sigurd.skogestad). Apart from working on my thesis, I also got enrolled in the Mathematics degree, completing the first three years (covering all the compulsory subjects) and some of the final year electives. However, I could not eventually complete the degree (pending of three more electives plus the final degree project) mostly due to time restrictions, especially after defending my thesis. Anyway, all in all it was fun and I enjoyed the ride a lot.


After finishing my PhD, I stayed one more year in my home department and obtained the accreditation for the (non-tenure track) Assistant Professor (Spanish level) and *Professor Lector* (Catalonia) positions. At the end of the day, that proved a futile task given the little chance to get a position at the university. So, I finally moved to Zwolle (The Netherlands), where I worked as a Postdoctoral *Marie Curie* fellow for two years in the company [Pure Air Solutions](http://www.pureairsolutions.nl/en/site/odour-and-voc-control) within the european IAPP project [Next Air Biotreat](http://www.nextairbiotreat.eu/). Then, I came back to Barcelona and started a new job as an Industrial Informatics & Automation Engineer. After one year or so I decided to shift my career and have ever since worked as a Fullstack Engineer at [Talaia](https://www.talaia.io/), a startup where we do what it takes to offer the best cloud-based network visibility as a service.


My interests include distributed systems, big data, and machine learning (I am currently enrolled on the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)). I have always had a taste for the signal processing and control theory disciplines. Finally, I'm lately getting into cryptocurrencies, too.


I will try to keep this page up to date (sort of), but if you have any questions or simply want to say hello please drop me a line [here](mailto:hi@salvalcantara.com).
