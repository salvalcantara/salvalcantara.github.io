Among the different cryptocurrencies out there, I feel very excited about what [IOTA](https://iota.org/) can bring to the table. Perhaps in the future I can find the time to write about it from a technical perspective and make a real contribution to its community. Today's post is just to have some fun while the sleeping giant takes the world by storm.

The genesis. One day my brother played a song from [basshunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basshunter)  on his phone. I really liked it, so I ended up looking for more songs from the same guy, and this is how I eventually came accross my favourite one: *DotA*. You can click on the image below for your own enjoyment.

After listening to the song several times, even my little son became a huge fan! The problem was that, not having played DotA in my entire life, the lyrics didn't mean much to me. Being a IOTA fan, however, I thought that a remake could be funny.

Long story short, I subsequently tried to reach *basshunter* on his twitter account ([here](https://twitter.com/salvalcantara/status/951202099316101120) you can see the original tweet). I also published [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7punpy/let_us_vote_for_a_remake_of_the_basshunter_dota/?ref=share&ref_source=link) post on the IOTA subreddit, where I proposed to vote for the best potential remake among all. As of this writing, so far I have not received any feedback from *basshunter*, nor any tentative lyrics from the subreddit. However, I've got some likes and/or positive comments so I finally decided to come up with my own remake:
